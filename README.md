# README BEFORE YOU START DEVELOPING

## Initial Setup

> I had no intention of having a difficult setup, but I don't want to use EF migrations so for now we have one step that I'm sure will get longer as we go.

1) [Install Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/download?_ga=2.53578923.2047073809.1634244558-1323351823.1631633244)
2) [Follow the instructions to set up Liquibase for PostgreSQL](https://docs.liquibase.com/workflows/database-setup-tutorials/postgresql.html)

> The Project has the Liquibase.properties file and the changelog, it also has the connection info for the database set up.
